A shell script to automate the setup of new linux development environments.

``` shell
git clone git@github.com:joryhatton/backpack.git
./backpack.sh
```

Backpack makes a few assumptions out of the box:
- You're using a Debian based distro.
- You're going to be using Ruby and/or Node.
- You're going to be using CLI tools such as git, zsh, vim, and tmux.

Backpack is best served within an existing `~/dotfiles` directory. See [mine](https://github.com/joryhatton/dotfiles) as an example.
